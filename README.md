## App Ideas
I have a few ideas for making an app! Since this will be my first app with Swift, I want to keep it realistic to my capabilities. A few ideas I'm thinking of are:

* A scheduling app (similar to When2meet but an app!) -- users will be able to share their availability with friends and family on a calendar
* Game Tracker/Journal App -- Some games, such as Animal Crossing, feature collectables that many people wish to keep track of. I think that having a general application to keep track of game progress might be useful!
* Game -- I would be interested in making a small game; maybe a platformer? (Similar to the dino Google Chrome game), OR a point-and-click adventure/escape-room-esque game

## APIS
For all of my ideas, I don't have any particular APIs I can think of at this moment. I'm sure there may be some visual feature-related APIs I'd like to utilize with a game, and I may use existing Calendar APIs if I decide on the scheduling app (e.g. for users to import their availability).
